# IST210-SQL
In Fall 2021 (my sophomore year of college), I completed a project in SQL with a group for my IST 210 class. We were required to create several different elements for this fake company (Flix2You) including a theoretical display for all of their website statistics and a Ghantt chart to explaint the connectivity of the databases. I was the project programmer, so the work displayed is all my own.
